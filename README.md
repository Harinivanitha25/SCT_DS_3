# SCT_DS_3
Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

# Dataset
Dataset is from UCI Machine Learning Repository of Bank Marketing.

# Decision Tree
  Here, Decision tree classifier is built to predict whether the customer will purchase a product or service. First, the dataset is downloaded and imported in the jupyter notebook.
  These are the steps used to build the Decision tree classifier,
     Importing Libraries: Required libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and model building.
     Loading the Dataset: Load the Bank Marketing dataset.
     Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset.
     Building the Model: Creating a decision tree classifier.
     Evaluating the Model: Checking model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.
     Visualize the Decision Tree.
